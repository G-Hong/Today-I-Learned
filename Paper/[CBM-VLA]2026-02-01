## TIL: Robotics Middleware & Action Scheduling for CBM-VLA

### Research Overview

I am developing a **Positional Alignment Manager**, a specialized middleware for **CBM-VLA (Concept Bottleneck Model VLA)**. This system bridges the gap between high-level **Action Concepts** generated by a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and the precise **low-level control commands** required for physical robot execution.

### Key Engineering Challenges & Solutions


#### Fault-Tolerant Execution (Recovery)

* 
**Problem**: Real-world environments are unpredictable (e.g., a gripper slipping during "Room Cleaning").


* **Solution**: Integrated a **Hierarchical State Manager** with an **Interrupt Monitor**.
* 
**Priority-based Preemption**: Emergency recovery tasks are assigned **Higher Priority** in the Task Queue, preempting normal operations. Defined **Error State** which can generate new Action Concepts.


* 
**Context-Aware Replanning**: The system captures the failure state (Last Successful Action Concept + Current Action Concept + Current Pose) and feeds it back to the VLM for immediate trajectory correction.





### 🛠 Tech Stack

* 
**Framework**: LeRobot (PyTorch-based robotics ecosystem).


* 
**Model**: SmolVLA (Backbone: SmolVLM-2 + SigLIP).


* 
**Optimization**: `torch.compile`, bfloat16 precision for real-time responsiveness.


* 
**Control**: Flow Matching Transformer for multi-modal action distribution modeling.
